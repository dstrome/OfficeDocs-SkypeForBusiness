Overview of security and compliance in Microsoft Teams
======================================================

Microsoft Teams is built on the Office 365 hyper-scale, enterprise-grade cloud, delivering the advanced security and compliance capabilities our customers expect.

Teams is Tier C-compliant at launch. This includes the following standards: ISO 27001, ISO 27018, SSAE16 SOC 1 and SOC 2, HIPAA, and EU Model Clauses (EUMC). Within the Microsoft compliance framework, Microsoft classifies Office 365 applications and services into four categories. Each category is defined by specific compliance commitments that must be met for an Office 365 service, or a related Microsoft service, to be listed in that category.

Services in compliance categories C and D that have industry-leading compliance commitments are enabled by default. Services in categories A and B come with controls to turn on or turn off these services for an entire organization. Details can be found in the [Compliance Framework for Industry Standards and Regulations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=855777). Microsoft Teams also supports Cloud Security Alliance compliance.

Teams also enforces team-wide and organization-wide two-factor authentication, single sign-on through Active Directory, and encryption of data in transit and at rest. Files are stored in SharePoint and are backed by SharePoint encryption. Notes are stored in OneNote and are backed by OneNote encryption.

We also added support for audit log search, eDiscovery and legal hold for channels, chats and files as well as mobile application management with Microsoft Intune.

These tools reside in the Office 365 Security and Compliance Portal and provide the following features:

-   Auditing and Reporting

    -   Audit log search plugs right into the Office 365 Security and Compliance Center and exposes abilities to set alerts and/or report on Audit event by making available, export of workload specific or generic event sets for admin use and investigation, across an unlimited auditing timeline. All Audit Log data is available for setting up of alerts within the Office 365 Security and Compliance Center, as well as for filtering and export for further analysis.

-   Compliance Content Search

    -   Content Search can be used to search Microsoft Teams through rich filtering capabilities and exported to a specific container for compliance and litigation support. This can be done with or without an eDiscovery case.

-   eDiscovery

    -   Electronic discovery is the electronic aspect of identifying, collecting and producing electronically stored information (ESI) in response to a request for production in a law suit or investigation.

    -   Capabilities include case management, preservation, search, analysis and export of Teams data. This includes chat, messaging and file data.

    -   Customers can leverage in-place eDiscovery or [Advanced eDiscovery](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-365-Advanced-eDiscovery-fd53438a-a760-45f6-9df4-861b50161ae4)

    -   The following table outlines the differences between the two:


| |In-place eDiscovery  |Advanced eDiscovery  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Case Management     |X        |X         |
|Access Control  |X         |X         |
|Content Searches     |X         | X        |
|Hold(s)   |X         | X        |
|Export     |X         |X         |
|Duplication Detection     |-         |X         |
|Relevance Searches with Machine Learning    |-         |X         |
|Unstructured Data Analysis      |-         |X         |


-   Legal Hold

    -   When any Team within Microsoft Teams is put on In-Place Hold or Litigation Hold, the hold is placed on the groups mailbox.

    -   Legal Holds are generally applied within the context of an eDiscovery case.

The figure below indicates the workflow of Teams data to both Exchange and SharePoint.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There can be up to a 24-hr delay to discover Teams content.

Additionally, Microsoft is considering providing the following security features for Teams. Once available, guidance will be provided on how customers can leverage the features:

-   Tenant-specific retention Policy

-   Data loss prevention (DLP)

-   Customer Lockbox

-   Right Management

Licensing
---------------

When it comes to the information protection capabilities, Office 365 subscriptions and the associated standalone licenses will determine the available feature set.

Before enabling any of these features, ensure you have access to the Security & Compliance Center in the Office 365 Admin center. By default, tenant admins have access.

Content Search and eDiscovery do not require enablement within the Security & Compliance Center.

Location of data in Microsoft Teams
-----------------------------------

Data in Teams resides in the region based on tenant affinity. Currently, Teams supports the Americas, EMEA, and APAC regions. 

As of November 1, 2017, Teams offers data residency in the United Kingdom for new tenants only. A new tenant is defined as any tenant that hasn’t had a single user from the tenant sign in to Microsoft Teams.

> [!NOTE]
> Existing tenants from the UK will continue to remain in EMEA, until a migration plan is published (which is anticipated in 2018).

For more information, see the Microsoft Teams tech community [blog post](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=862275) about the launch of UK data residency.

Privacy in Microsoft Teams
--------------------------

As a customer of Office 365, you own and control your data. Microsoft does not use your data for anything other than providing you with the service that you have subscribed to. As a service provider, we do not scan your email, documents, or teams for advertising or for purposes that are not service-related. Microsoft doesn’t have access to uploaded content. Like OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online, customer data stays within the tenant.

Check out more about our trust and security related information at the [*Office 365 Trust Center*](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=855779). Teams follows the same guidance and principles as the Office 365 Trust Center.
