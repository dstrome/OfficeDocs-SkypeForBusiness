Search the audit log for events in Microsoft Teams
==================================================

The Audit Log provides ad-hoc search capabilities into notable events across Office 365 services. For Microsoft Teams specifically, below are a few examples of events captured:

-   Team Creation

-   Team Deletion

-   Added Channel

-   Changed Setting

The complete event list across Office 365 is quite extensive and can be found [here](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Search-the-audit-log-in-the-Office-365-Security-Compliance-Center-0d4d0f35-390b-4518-800e-0c7ec95e946c?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US#ID0EABAAA=Audited_activities).

Before you can dig into audit insights, auditing must first be enabled. To enable Auditing, navigate to the *Security & Compliance* Admin Center. Under *Search for activity*, click on **Start recording now**. After 24hrs, audit data will be available via *Audit Log Search* located under the *Search & Investigation* tab.
