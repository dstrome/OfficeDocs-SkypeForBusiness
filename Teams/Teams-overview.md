Microsoft Teams brings together the full breadth and depth of Office 365, to provide a true chat-based hub for teamwork and give customers the opportunity to create a more open, fluid, and digital environment. Microsoft Teams is built on existing Microsoft technologies woven together by Office 365 Groups. 

Out of the box, Teams leverages identities stored in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and integrates with the other services within Office 365, to create a SharePoint online site and an Exchange Online group mailbox for each team created.

The Teams persistent chat capability is provided by a chat service that interacts with the Office 365 substrate, surfacing many of the built-in Office 365 capabilities, such as archiving and eDiscovery to the data being exchanged in Teams.

Teams also provides a calling and meetings experience that is built on the next generation cloud-based infrastructure that is also used by Skype and Skype for Business. These technology investments include Azure-based cloud services for media processing and signaling, H.264 video codec, SILK and Opus audio codec, network resiliency, telemetry, and quality diagnostics.

To extend Teams capabilities, use Connectors, Tabs, and Bots - available as [Apps](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=854629), to bring external information, content, and intelligent bot interactions to Teams.

Microsoft Teams infrastructure
------------------------------

Teams is built on existing Microsoft technologies, woven together by Office 365 Groups. Powered by the Microsoft cloud, organizations can expect excellent performance and reliability when leveraging Teams as part of their collaboration story.

Out of the box, a team created in Teams will create an Office 365 Group, a SharePoint Online site (complete with a document library), and an Exchange Online group mailbox, which will be used by Teams to store information such as meeting invites. A team can be created using existing Office 365 Groups, allowing existing group memberships, and contents stored in SharePoint Online and Exchange Online to be ported to Teams.

Teams persistent chat is provided by a chat service that interacts with Office 365, surfacing many of the built-in Office 365 capabilities such as archiving and eDiscovery to the data being exchanged in Teams.

To complement the Teams capability as a persistent chat board where informal, real-time conversations take place, Teams also provides a meeting experience built on the next generation cloud-based infrastructure that is also used by Skype and Skype for Business. These technology investments include Azure-based cloud services for media processing and signaling, H.264 video codec, SILK and Opus audio codec, network resiliency, telemetry, and quality diagnostics.

Office 365 Groups leverage identities stored in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and as such, all authentication and authorization capabilities in Azure AD, such as support for multi-factor authentication (MFA), are readily available for use by Teams.


Microsoft Teams and Office 365
------------------------------

Different groups have various needs, based on their functional role and workstyle. Office 365 is designed for the unique workstyle of every group and includes purpose-built, integrated applications, including:

-   Outlook for enterprise-grade email, now with groups functionality

-   SharePoint for sites and portals, intelligent content services, business process automation and enterprise search

-   Yammer for driving company-wide connections

-   Skype for Business as the backbone for enterprise voice and video

-   And now, Microsoft Teams, the new chat-based workspace in Office 365

Here are common use cases for each application in Office 365. For detailed usage guidance, visit the [FastTrack Productivity Library](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=854630).

## What happened to the Teams admin FAQ?

While the Teams Admin FAQ was handy when we first released Teams, it quickly became a "junk drawer" that made it hard to find anything specific. So we busted apart the FAQ and incorporated its valuable information into the Teams documentation that you're looking at right now. You'll find all the information that was in the FAQ in this documentation, in context.

If you're looking for something that you can't find here, please tell us about it in the **Comments** section below. We try to respond to your comments within 24 hours.

By the way, we **do** still have an FAQ for the [Journey from Skype for Business to Microsoft Teams](FAQ-journey.md).
