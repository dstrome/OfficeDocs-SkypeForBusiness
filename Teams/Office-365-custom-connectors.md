Use Office 365 and custom connectors in Microsoft Teams
=======================================================

Connectors keep your team current by delivering content and updates from services you frequently use directly into a channel. With connectors, your Microsoft Teams users can receive updates from popular services such as Twitter, Trello, Wunderlist, GitHub, and VSTS within the chat stream in their team.

Any member of a team can connect their team to popular cloud services with the connectors, and all team members are notified of activities from that service. If a user is removed from a team, any connectors added to the team by the removed user do stop working. Scheduled meetings continue to work because they're on the group calendar.

Office 365 connectors can be used with both Microsoft Teams and Office 365 groups, making it easier for all members stay in sync and receive relevant information quickly. Both Microsoft Teams and Exchange use the same connector model, which allows you to use the same connectors within both platforms.

Currently, connectors can be added by using Microsoft Teams desktop and web clients. However, information posted by these connectors can be viewed using **all clients** including mobile.

1.  To add a connector to a channel, click the **ellipses (…),** on the right of a channel name, then click **Connectors.**

2.  Users can select from a variety of available connectors, then click **Add**.

3.  Fill in the required information of the selected connector and click **Save**. Each connector requires a diverse set of information to function properly, and some may require you to sign in to the service using the links provided on the connector configuration page.

4.  Data provided by the connector is automatically posted to the channel.

Develop custom connectors
-----------------------------

It is very easy to develop custom connectors that can integrate into your Line-of-Business (LOB) applications. You can use the built-in **Incoming Webhook** connector to create an endpoint for a channel, that pulls data from any application using HTTP post methods.

1.  Add the **Incoming Webhook** like any other connector.

2.  To create a Webhook, specify a **name**, update the Webhook image, if necessary, and click **Create**.

3.  Applications that push data to this channel, require the Webhook connector URL. A **unique URL** is created when you created the **Webhook**. Share this URL with your developers, so that they can configure their applications to push data, as needed.

    ![Screenshot of the unique URL of the Webhook.](media/Use_Office_365_and_custom_connectors_in_Microsoft_Teams_image7.png)

4.  When an external application pushes data to a connector, the message is shown in the channel conversation list as a special message called a **Connector Card** message.

Developers can configure their applications to create these cards, by sending an HTTP request with a simple JSON payload to a Microsoft Team’s Webhook address, that is a unique URL of that endpoint provided by the wizard. Have your developers refer to [Getting started with Office 365 Connectors for Microsoft Teams](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=855783), on the Microsoft Developer Network, with detailed instructions and connector samples.
