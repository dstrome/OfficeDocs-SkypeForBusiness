Cloud voice deployment
======================

Microsoft Teams, the hub for teamwork and communications in Office 365, now provides Audio Conferencing and Phone System with Calling Plans capabilities to meet additional business requirements by extending the Teams meeting and calling experience to include external parties connected via the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).
 
Use the [practical guidance for Audio Conferencing](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/audio-conferencing) to help you plan the deployment of Audio Conferencing in Teams.

 
We'll update this page as additional cloud voice features for Teams are released over time.
