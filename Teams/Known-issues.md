Updated: September 14, 2017 
  
The following table lists the known issues for Microsoft Teams.
## 

|**Issue title**|**Behavior / Symptom**|**Known workaround**|**Discovery date**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Safari web client support  <br/> |Users trying to open the Microsoft Teams web client on Safari are directed to download the desktop client. Microsoft is looking into Safari support and will share updates via the public Office 365 Roadmap.  <br/> |Use supported browsers, which include: Microsoft Edge 12+, Internet Explorer 11+, Firefox 47.0+, and Chrome 51.0+.  <br/> |11/2/16  <br/> |
|Users can't recreate a pre-existing channel name  <br/> |Once a channel name has been created, even if it's deleted, it cannot be recreated. Our system maintains this data for information protection scenarios.  <br/> |No workaround.  <br/> |3/13/2017  <br/> |
|Unable to insert stickers using mobile app  <br/> |You can't use stickers on the mobile apps.  <br/> |No workaround.  <br/> |3/13/2017  <br/> |
|Skype for Business required for some meetings  <br/> |Your calendar of appointments is conveniently displayed within Microsoft Teams. To enter a meeting, click the **Join** button. <br/> While we are continuing development in this area, if this meeting was scheduled with Skype for Business and you click **Join**, Microsoft Teams will launch your Skype for Business client to complete your entrance into the meeting. Meetings scheduled within Microsoft Teams will initiate directly within the product.  <br/> In the future, we will streamline this experience.  <br/> |Click **Join**. Microsoft Teams will intelligently decide whether Skype for Business is required for a user to join the meeting based on the URL included in the meeting description.  <br/> |3/13/17  <br/> |
|Team members can't be reached for ad-hoc meetings  <br/> |Ad hoc meetings are supported if both people are using the latest app. Meetings are not yet supported on the web client or Windows Phone app.  <br/> |Download and install the latest desktop, iOS, or Android app to join the meeting.  <br/> |11/2/2016  <br/> |
|Missing **Meetings** icon in the left nav bar <br/> |The **Meetings** icon on the app bar is currently only enabled for users whose mailbox is on Office 365 multi-tenant and a select few dedicated users whose mailbox location can be discovered using Exchange auto discovery. <br/> Microsoft Teams does not yet support mailboxes housed in Exchange on-premises and Exchange Dedicated. This is under investigation; however, there is no timing for delivering this capability.  <br/> |No workaround.  <br/> ||
|Attendee maximum for meetings  <br/> |Each Microsoft Teams meeting can have up to 80 attendees.  <br/> |No workaround.  <br/> |3/13/2017  <br/> |
|Unable to join meetings from the Windows mobile client  <br/> |You cannot join a team meeting from the Windows Phone app.  <br/> |Support for joining meetings from Window Phone is coming soon.  <br/> ||
|Mobile Teams client layout differences  <br/> |Teams are listed in alphabetical order, and the channels cannot be collapsed on the mobile client.  <br/> |No workaround.  <br/> |3/13/2017  <br/> |
|List of workspaces is not alphabetized  <br/> |Users switching workspaces when adding a PowerBI tab will encounter an unalphabetized list of workspaces to switch between.  <br/> |No workaround.  <br/> ||
|Scroll bar disappears when selecting reports  <br/> |Users adding PowerBI reports can't scroll through a list longer than one screen of reports without losing their scroll bar.  <br/> |Use Up and Down arrows to scroll through the list.  <br/> ||
|Can't add more than five users at a time  <br/> |Public teams do not currently support adding more than five users simultaneously. The limit is 2500 for total membership.  <br/> |A future release will address this issue.  <br/> |3/13/2017  <br/> |
|No external access to the Teams workspace  <br/> |External access is not currently available, but guest access is on the Microsoft Teams roadmap for August 2017.  <br/> |No workaround.  <br/> |11/2/2016  <br/> |
|Users can't create a team  <br/> |Your company may have set a policy restricting who can create Office 365 groups or teams.  <br/> |Check with your IT admin to understand your company's policy for creating groups and teams.  <br/> |3/13/2017  <br/> |
|Team member maximum of 2500  <br/> |Each Microsoft Team can have a maximum of 2500 members per team.  <br/> |No workaround.  <br/> |3/13/2017  <br/> |
|Deleting a team will also delete the group associated with it  <br/> |Users may not realize that the underlying Office 365 Group is deleted when the team is deleted. Additionally, if the underlying Office 365 Group is deleted, the team is deleted as well.  <br/> |Additional language in Microsoft Teams provides this information to the user. This information is not present in the Office 365 Groups interface.  <br/> |3/13/2017  <br/> |
|Group mailboxes are not enabled for archival (extra storage) purposes  <br/> |In the Office 365 Security and Compliance Center, Global Admins cannot enable archival on Group mailboxes. They can do this on user mailboxes only.  <br/> |If the Group mailbox capacity is nearly full, please contact Microsoft Office Support to extend mailbox size.  <br/> |2/1/2017  <br/> |
|Skype for Business on-premises users aren't getting my messages  <br/> |Messages will not complete when Microsoft Teams users try to send a message to another individual who is using Skype for Business on-premises.  <br/> | Interoperability between Teams and users hosted on Skype for Business Online is supported. Teams users can send 1:1 chats to non-Teams users using Skype for Business Online. <br/> Interoperability between Teams and users hosted on Skype for Business on-premises is not supported. Teams users cannot send 1:1 chats to non-Teams users using Skype for Business on-premises.  <br/> |11/2/2016  <br/> |

|Public team list does not display all teams  <br/> |The list of public teams is based on the Microsoft Graph.  <br/> |If you don't see a team, try searching for it in the top right search box.  <br/> ||
|Incorrect SharePoint user created for Microsoft Teams SharePoint site  <br/> |The SharePoint creator for a Microsoft Teams Group appears to be a SharePoint Admin, not the correct user.  <br/> When auditing from the SharePoint administration console, the creator for the site collection page associated with the Office 365 Group created against the team in Microsoft Teams is the SharePoint admin.  <br/> |No workaround.  <br/> |7/21/17  <br/> |
|Date format and digit separator use US format instead of EU format  <br/> |When changing the language settings in Microsoft Teams, the date format and digit separator are not changed to the country-specific settings.  <br/> |No workaround.  <br/> |7/13/17  <br/> |

|Connector options are missing for some teams  <br/> |When you right-click a channel, the Connectors option is not present for any member of the team.  <br/> |The creator of the team must have an online mailbox; otherwise, no Connector option will be available. This is expected behavior.  <br/> |6/26/17  <br/> |
|Modern authentication failure  <br/> |When there is an initial failure with multi-factor authentication, use the web app for authentication.  <br/> For more information, see  [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/ad-fs-prompt-login](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/ad-fs-prompt-login.aspx).  <br/> |Check this setting: Set -MsolDomainFederationSettings -DomainName yourdomainhere -PreferredAuthenticationProtocol WsFed -SupportsMfa $False -PromptLoginBehavior Disabled.  <br/> |6/19/17  <br/> |
|Planner single sign-on (SSO)  <br/> |SSO does not apply to Planner. You will have to sign in again the first time you use Planner on each client.  <br/> |No workaround. Further authentication enhancements are being worked on.  <br/> |2/28/17  <br/> |

|Outlook add-in limitations  <br/> |To use the Outlook add-in, you must sign in to Teams using multi-factor authentication (MFA). If MFA fails halfway through the sign-in process, you'll still be able to sign into Teams, but you'll get an error message when you try to use the add-in.  <br/> The add-in is only available for Windows users for the time being.  <br/> The add-in won't work if you're using an authentication proxy.  <br/> | No workaround. <br/> |8/2/17  <br/> |
|Green artifacts in Chrome video rendering  <br/> |Green artifacts appear while viewing video or sharing the screen in a call or meet up in Chrome.  <br/> |Disable the hardware acceleration setting in Chrome.  <br/> |8/3/17  <br/> |

|Wiki not created for channels created by guests  <br/> |When a guest creates a new channel, the **Wiki** tab is not created. There isn't a way to manually attach a **Wiki** tab to the channel. <br/> |No workaround.  <br/> ||
