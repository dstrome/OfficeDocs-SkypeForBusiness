Compare Skype for Business features with Teams
==========================================================

The following tables show the features that are available with each client that works with Skype for Business Server 2015 or Skype for Business Online. You may also want to refer to Mobile client comparison tables for Skype for Business. The Client Access License or User Subscription License your organization purchases will also have an impact on which features are available to your users.
