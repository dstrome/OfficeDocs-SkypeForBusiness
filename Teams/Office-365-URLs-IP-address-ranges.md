Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges
=====================================

Please review the following link for a detailed and up to date list of the exact IP’s and ports that must be correctly configured: [Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US). Microsoft is continuously improving the Office 365 service and adding new functionalities, therefore the required ports, URLs and IP addresses may change over time. Please refer to [Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges](https://support.office.com/article/Office-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2) guide for the latest versions of ports and protocols. It is also highly recommended to [subscribe via RSS](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=236301) to receive notifications when endpoints are updated or changed.

As mentioned, Microsoft Teams calling and meetings experience is built on the next generation cloud based infrastructure that is also used by Skype and Skype for Business. These technology investments include Azure-based cloud services for media processing and signaling, H.264 video codec, SILK and Opus audio codec, network resiliency, telemetry and quality diagnostics. As such, there are URLs and IPs that are required that may be associated with both Skype and Skype for Business.

For all Office 365 workloads, the recommended connection method to Microsoft Teams services is bypassing the forward proxy where possible. When a proxy server sits between a client and the Office 365 datacenters, media might be forced over TCP instead of UDP, that would impact media quality. A sample proxy PAC files that can be used to configure traffic bypass can be downloaded from [Managing Office 365 endpoints](https://support.office.com/article/managing-Office-365-endpoints-99cab9d4-ef59-4207-9f2b-3728eb46bf9a) guide.

If your networking and security policies require Office 365 traffic to flow through a proxy server, then make sure that the above requirements are already met before deploying Microsoft Teams into production (review [Proxy Servers for Skype for Business Online](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Proxy-Servers-for-Skype-for-Business-Online-7acaf2c2-35fa-490f-84cd-822e446e0fc7?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US) for guidance.)
