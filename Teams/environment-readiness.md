Check your environment’s readiness for Microsoft Teams
===========================================

The transition to the cloud will vary by each organization, and current state may have an impact on how Microsoft Teams will function.

To get the best experience on Microsoft Teams, your organization must have deployed Exchange Online and SharePoint Online. If not, or you have a different setup, refer to the following links for help:

-   If your organization has not deployed any Office 365 workloads, see [Getting Started with Office 365 for business.](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-started-with-Office-365-for-Business-d6466f0d-5d13-464a-adcb-00906ae87029)

-   If your organization has not added or configured a verified domain for Office 365, see [Verify your Office 365 domain](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Verify-your-Office-365-domain-to-prove-ownership-nonprofit-or-education-status-or-to-activate-Yammer-87d1844e-aa47-4dc0-a61b-1b773fd4e590).

-   If your organization has not synchronized identities to Azure Active Directory, see [Identity models and authentication in Microsoft Teams](identify-models-authentication.md).

-   If your organization does not have Exchange Online, see [Understand how Exchange and Microsoft Teams interact](Exchange-Teams-interact.md).

-   If your organization does not have SharePoint Online, see [Understand how SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business interact with Microsoft Teams](SharePoint-OneDrive-interact.md).
